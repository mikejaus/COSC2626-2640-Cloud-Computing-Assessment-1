### Personal Assignment notes:
This assessment in particular was a challenge, as i was notified that the subject would be difficult for those without a proficiency in php / python, and both of these languages i have only done slight projects with. For the first two weeks of subject start i was studying python and flask docs so that i could put this together and in my eyes it worked out well.
